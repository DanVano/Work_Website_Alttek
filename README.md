# Alttek Website

Using a legacy Weebly UI template, I rebuilt Alttek’s informational website from scratch in clean HTML/CSS, removing Weebly dependencies and improving structure, responsiveness, and maintainability.

## What this repo contains
This is a simple static website for Alttek Enterprises Ltd. It includes:
- Home page and interior pages (About, Technology Services, Contact, Search)
- A consistent header/nav system with desktop + mobile behavior
- Reusable hero sections (custom Home hero, standardized interior hero)
- A simplified 3-column footer layout

## Goals of the rebuild
- Remove Weebly specific HTML/CSS and replace it with standard semantic structure
- Move off of Weebly hosting to save the company a monthly fee
- Keep the visual look as close as possible to the original site
- Make responsive behavior predictable at common breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Keep the CSS organized and easier to maintain going forward
